Popular icon options for dropdowns include:

**Recommended Icons:**
- `FullCircleMask` - Solid filled circle (default)
- `Circle` - Outlined circle

**Usage Tips:**
- Use simple, recognizable shapes for best results
- Circular icons work particularly well with color customization

- Fallback to color indicators if icons don't load

#### Color Customization Guide

**Color Sources:**
1. **Choice Field Colors**: Colors defined in the Power Platform choice field
2. **Color Override**: Single hex color applied to all options (overrides choice field colors)

**Color Applications:**
- **Icons**: Color the icon itself
- **Borders**: Apply color to the dropdown border
- **Backgrounds**: Use color as background with three intensity levels:
  - **No**: No background color (default)
  - **Lighter**: 80% opacity background for subtle effect
  - **Full**: Full color background for maximum impact

**Best Practices:**
- Use **Lighter** backgrounds for better text readability
- Combine **Color Icons** with **Color Borders** for professional appearance
- **Color Override** useful for maintaining brand consistency
- Test color combinations for accessibility compliance
